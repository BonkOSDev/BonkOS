Dear User,
Thank you for your use of BonkOS. Our team is created by 3 in Cambridge,England, and we are hoping to introduce a new distro for our personal use and
commercial use around. The distro is built of Ubuntu and the tools we use are Cubic (Running of Zorin OS) and is a work in progress. The computer 
requirements are; 1GB RAM, 1GHz CPU, 2.5GB of disk space. Our recommendations are; 4GB DDDR4 2400Mhz RAM, Intel i5 5th Gen or Equivalent, 1366x768.
This version, is NOT FOR DISTROBUTION.  Any use of this Operating System before a non Developer Release is not okay. If you do wish to talk about releases
or have issues that can be fixed please use this forum: 'bonkos.boards.net'. Any other site claiming to be us, except this GitHUB is an impersonator, please
use Telegram to communicate with admins for any reason.
