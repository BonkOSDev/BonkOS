Dear User,
Thank you for your use of BonkOS. Our team is created by 3 in Cambridge,England, and we are hoping to introduce a new distro for our personal use and
commercial use around. Keep in mind that this operating system (based on Ubuntu 22.04LTB) is still a work in progress. On our forum, bonkos.boards.net, we will keep in touch with the progress and experimental features. The computer requirements are; 1GB RAM, 1GHz CPU, 2.5GB of disk space. Our recommendations are; 4GB DDDR4 2400Mhz RAM, Intel i5 5th Gen or Equivalent, 1366x768. This version, is NOT FOR DISTROBUTION.  Any use of this Operating System before a non Developer Release is not okay. If you do wish to talk about releasepixlr or have issues that can be fixed please use this forum: 'bonkos.boards.net'. Any other site claiming to be us, except this GitHUB is an impersonator, please use Telegram Messenger (@scruppy404) or use E-mail (bonkos_dev@outlook.com) to communicate with admins for any reason. New Info: We have a Google Site now! We are still working on a domain but in the meantime, use sites.google.com/sites/bonkos . This page was last updated on 12th March 2023, 12:32AM.
